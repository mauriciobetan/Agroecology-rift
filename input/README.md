# Input Directory

This directory should contain unedited data files directly from the source. I typically put different data sources into different sub-directories and include any relevant data documentation in the same directory. 

Following the guidelines of [Code and Data](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.xhtml#magicparlabel-270), this directory is dedicated to raw data from other sources ONLY. Datasets in this input directory should NEVER be edited. If newer data extracts are used, older raw data should just be replaced and changes commmitted. Constructed datasets should NEVER be placed in this directory. 

Once you put data here, you should use this README to document what data you added. 

Through this data, the relationship between agricultural production, environmental degradation, and food security in Latin America through time can be analyzed. 

# I. FAO Datasets. 
All this data was obtained from the FAO statistics, available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data. For all datasets, all countries and years available were selected.

1. The synthetic fertilizers dataset was obtained from the Emissions-Agriculture heading, Synthetic Fertilizers subtitle, and the Emissions (CO2eq) Element was selected. This dataset can be obtained here: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GY. 

2. The food production dataset was obtained from the Production heading, Crops subtitle; the Items added were "Beans, dry," "Maize," "Rice, paddy," and "Sugar cane"; the selected Element was "Yield" exclusively. This dataset can be obtained here: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC.

3. The food supply dataset was obtained from the Food Balance heading, Food Supply - Crops Primary Equivalent subtitle, the "Grand Total + (Total)" aggregated Item was chosen, and so was the "Food supply (kcal/capita/day)" Element was selected. This dataset can be obtained from: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/CC.

4. The machinery use in agriculture dataset was obtained from the Investment heading, the Machinery subtitle, the "Agricultural tractors" Item, and the "In use" element. This dataset is available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RM.

5. The energy use in agriculture dataset was obtained from the Agri-Environmental Indicators heading, Energy subtitle, "Energy used in agriculture and forestry" Item, and "Percentage of total Energy Use/Production" element. This dataset is available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/EE.

6. The land use dataset was obtained from the Agri-Environmental Indicators heading, Land Use subtitle, "Agricultural area," and "Forest" Items, and the "Share in Land area" element. This dataset is available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/EL.

7. The agricultural emissions dataset was obtained from the Agri-Environmental Indicators heading, Emissions by sector subtitle, "Agricultural total" Item, and the "Emissions (CO2eq)" element. This data only has data from 1990 onwards. This dataset is available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/EM.

8. The emissions intensity dataset was obtained from the Agri-Environmental Indicators heading, Emissions intensities, "Cereals excluding rice" Item, and the "Emission intensity" element.This dataset is available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/EI.

9. The fertilizer use dataset was obtained from the Inputs heading, Fertilizers archive subtitle, the "Total Fertilizers + (Total)" Aggregated Item, and the "Consumption" element. This dataset is available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RA.

10. The manure applied to soils dataset was obtained from the Emissions-Agriculture heading, Manure applied to Soils subtitle, the "All Animals + (Total)" Agreggated Item, and the "Manure (N content)" element. This dataset is available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GU.


# II. World Bank datasets.

All this data was obtained from World Bank Open Data datasets, available at: https://data.worldbank.org/. For all datasets, all countries and years available were selected.

1.The arable land dataset was obtained from: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.ARBL.HA.

2. The Food exports (% of merchandise exports) dataset was obtained from: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/TX.VAL.FOOD.ZS.UN.

3. The Food imports (% of merchandise imports) dataset was obtained from: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/TM.VAL.FOOD.ZS.UN.

4. The Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (% of GDP) dataset was obtained from: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.AGR.TOTL.ZS. 

5. The Urban population growth (annual %) dataset was obtained from: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.URB.GROW.
