# Input Directory

This directory contains unedited data files directly from the sources.

I. Websites from where the different datasets were downloaded. For all datasets, all countries, and years available were selected.
1. Percentage of land dedicated to agriculture (FAOSTAT). Retrieved from: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/EL. (Items: “agricultural land” and “forest land”; elements: “share in land area”).
2. Percentage of forest land (FAOSTAT). Retrieved from: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/EL. (Items: “agricultural land” and “forest land”; elements: “share in land area”).
3. Crop yields (hg/ha) (FAOSTAT). Retrieved from: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC. (Items: “maize” and “beans, dry”; elements: “Yield”). 
4. Tractors per 100 km2 of arable land (World Bank). Retrieved from: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.TRAC.ZS. 
5. Fertilizer use per arable land (t and ha, respectively) (both FAOSTAT and World Bank): The FAOSTAT data on fertilizer use was retrieved from: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RA. (Items aggregated: “Total Fertilizers + (Total)”; elements: “Consumption”. The World Bank’s data on arable land was retrieved from: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.ARBL.HA. 
6.  Average yearly rainfall (mm) (WB CCKP). Retrieved from: https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/download-data. (Variable: “Temperature”; Country: the 22 countries in the study were selected; Time period: “1901-2015”). When this dataset was downloaded on January 30, 2019, it contained data up until 2015. At present, this information has been updated to include 2016 data, which slightly modifies the values of previous years, perhaps by means of some normalization the CCKP uses. At any rate, this doesn’t alter the results shown in Table 1 in the article. 
7. Average annual temperature (°C) (WB CCKP). Retrieved from: https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/download-data. (Variable: “Temperature”; Country: the 22 countries in the study were selected; Time period: “1901-2015”). When this dataset was downloaded on January 30, 2019, it contained data up until 2015.

At any rate, this doesn’t alter the results shown in Table 1 in the article.

II. For the supplementary material analysis, for all datasets all countries and years available were selected. 
1. Total yields of aggregated crops (hg/ha) (FAOSTAT). Retrieved from: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC. (Items aggregated: "Cereals, Total + (Total)"+ ... + "Vegetables Primary (Total)"; elements: "Yield"). 
2. Total energy use (terajoules) (FAOSTAT). Retrieved from: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GN. (Items aggregated: "Total Energy + (Total)"; elements: "Consumption in Agriculture").
3. Energy use in power irrigation and fuel oil (FAOSTAT). Retrieved from: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GN. (Items: "Fuel oil" + "Energy for power irrigation"; elements: "Consumption in Agriculture").
